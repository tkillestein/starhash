Why? Because modern astronomy is hard enough, without mixing up sequentially-generated object names. Assigning memorable names to objects not only minimises the chance of triggering precious telescope time on the wrong thing, but reduces cognitive load. Every 3 arcsecond patch of sky now has a unique 3-word combination associated with it! Example Instead of SN2024cld or ra=237.589792 dec=+18.93895 You get: armrest-fraying-bullion Installation To avoid issues with dependencies, we recommend setting up a virtual environment using your favourite package manager. Then: pip install starhash or with uv uv add starhash Quickstart StarHash ships a basic CLI for quick queries by default starhash get-name-from-coord --ra=321.4214 --dec=-54.21231 starhash get-coord-from-name gathering-equinox-approach Development and contributing git clone https://github.com/tkillestein/starhash.git Then create the dev environment: uv sync --all-groups --python>=3.11 Install the pre-commit hooks pre-commit install And you're ready to go! Before committing any changes, run pytest to confirm that the hashing code still satisfies the round-trip property. Documentation is built via mkdocs - add Markdown files to docs and edit the mkdocs.yml file to build pages there. Then commit and push your changes, and run mkdocs gh-deploy to update the documentations site.
